# GcodeMacros

RepRapFirmware allows for user macros to be stored and run. This repository is a store of examples of useful macros.

Documentation is maintained here:

https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Macros

RepRapFirmware also uses macros to conduct many user configurable routines such as homing, tool changing, bed probing etc.

Examples are contained here in the system macro directory.

**WARNING!**
Many of the files here are user-contributed and not tested by Duet3D. **Duet3D Limited accepts no responsibility for any consequences arising from using these files**. So you use them at your own risk!

Caution these macros may not be kept up to date with the latest version of RepRapFirmware or may use gcodes form a newer version of RepRapFirmware than the one you are running.
